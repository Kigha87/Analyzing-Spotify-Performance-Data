## About the Project
This project analyzes Spotify's performance data to generate insights for:
- **User growth and strategy stakeholder:** User growth trends for premium and ad-supported users.
- **Revenue stakeholder:** Revenue performance, ARPU trends, and monetization strategies.
- **Operational stakeholder:** KPIs to optimize operations and user experience.


Dashboards are built using **Tableau** for clear data visualization.

## Data Source
- **Spotify Data:** Available to us by our instructors 


## Tableau Dashboards
Here are the key dashboards:

### Strategy Dashboard
*User growth trends over time (premium vs. ad-supported).*

### Revenue Dashboard
*Revenue trends, ARPU, and insights.*

### Operations Dashboard
*Operational KPIs including churn rate, engagement, and service quality.*

## Key Insights
- **User Growth:** Premium users have a 10% YoY growth, while ad-supported users fluctuate with seasonal trends.
- **Revenue:** ARPU has declined due to regional pricing changes.
- **Operations:** Churn rate is highest in Q1, possibly due to subscription fatigue post-holidays.
